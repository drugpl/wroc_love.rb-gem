== Contributing to wroc_love.rb
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to invite speakers and request features
* Spread the word! `wroc_love.rb follow`
* Tweet and blog until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to show up. This is important so the conference is not a total disaster.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
